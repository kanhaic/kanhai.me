I have started building my own trading engine and will be built using event-based trading system in python first to get started and then I plan to move it either nodejs or golang.

the website's name is [eazyalgo.com](https://www.eazyalgo.com/?utm_source=kanhai.me&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog)
