There are a few good trading strategies which I would like to maintain here

### January Month Breakout

**Rules for the Trade**

1. Buy if Index Breaks High of January 
2. Exit if index Breaks Low of January
3. Exit in December if point 2 is not hit.

### Weekly Expiry Straddle without Adjustment

**Rules of the Trade**

1. Sell ATM straddle on NIFTY/BANKNIFTY 2 days before the expiry (Tuesday at 9.30am)
2. SL is 100% of the Premium received on each side 
3. Exit only the loosing side if SL is hit.

### Turtle Trading Strategy

**Rules of the Trade**

1. Buy when stock price crosses 20 day high and hold
2. Exit when the stock breaks the 20 day low.
3. this is a long only strategy
