I will be staring on my algo journey and would be documenting how I have gone about it and what worked and what did not work.

Before starting here are a few things I think are important and are items I will be paying attention to

1. Strategy
2. Broker API
3. Historical Data and backtesting
4. Execution 
5. Monitoring Positions
6. Money management and Exits
7. Building Reports.
